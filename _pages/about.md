I was an algorithm engineer in the trustworthy AI research group at JD Explore Academy, [JD.com, Inc](https://corporate.jd.com/).
I received MPhil in Computer Science from [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), supervised by Prof. [Dacheng Tao](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dacheng-tao.html), and BSc in Mathematics from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/), supervised by Prof. [Chuhua Xian](https://chuhuaxian.github.io/).


My research lies in trustworthy AI, especially the security and privacy aspects of machine learning.
I am interested in using mathematical principles to identify and mitigate security and privacy risks in real-world machine learning systems.
<!--adversarially robust and privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms.-->
