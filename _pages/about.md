<!--I am currently a remote research intern in the [Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics (PRADA) Lab](http://www.pradalab.org/) at the [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/), under the supervision of Prof. [Di Wang](https://shao3wangdi.github.io/).-->

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Provable Responsible AI and Data Analytics (PRADA) Lab](http://www.pradalab.org/) at the [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/), advised by [Prof. Di Wang](https://shao3wangdi.github.io/).

Before that, I was an algorithm engineer at the trustworthy AI research group at JD Explore Academy, [JD.com, Inc](https://corporate.jd.com/).
I received MPhil in Computer Science from [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), advised by [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/dacheng-tao.html), and B.Sc in Mathematics from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Chuhua Xian](https://chuhuaxian.github.io/).


My research lies in trustworthy AI, especially the security and privacy aspects of machine learning.
I am interested in using mathematical principles to identify and mitigate security and privacy risks in real-world machine learning systems.
<!--adversarially robust and privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms.-->
